# Sabbath
a day of religious observance and abstinence from work, kept by Jews from Friday evening to Saturday evening, and by most Christians on Sunday.
Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews 
Ashkenazim v'Sepharadim (in Hebrew)

Level: Basic

• There are several subgroups of Jews with different culture and traditions:
Ashkenazic: Descendants of Jews from France, Germany and Eastern Europe
Sephardic: Descendants of Jews from Spain, Portugal, North Africa and the Middle East
Mizrachi: Descendants of Jews from North Africa and the Middle East
• Other subgroups are Yemenite, Ethiopian and Oriental
Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews represent two distinct subcultures of Judaism. We are all Jews and share the same basic beliefs, but there are some variations in culture and practice. It's not clear when the split began, but it has existed for more than a thousand years, because around the year 1000 C.E., Rabbi Gershom ben Judah issued an edict against polygamy that was accepted by Ashkenazim but not by Sephardim.

This Sabbath, I discovered;
You struggle so your faith matures. Although my faith is maturing in Christ, I crave for a deeper restoration. A study of His surroundings, The Jewish community. He was raised by the people specifically chosen by God. I want to be more Christ like, to connect with God. And what a better time than Erev Shovout, the celebration of the giving of the Torah.
I inspire for all Jewish communities to see my interests as a humble request to study and strengthen my relationship with God. I want learn the basics, believe and appreciate in Jesus, and learn about God.
